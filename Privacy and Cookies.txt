Privacy Policy Updates.
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Proctorio may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Proctorio will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at proctorio.com and may not notify you of the updated posting. Proctorio encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of Personally Identifiable Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use.
You can generally visit our Site without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself. In order to use the Services, however, we may be required to collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, phone number, and institution ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Additionally, we may invite you to participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, contact us with questions or comments or provide us with feedback, which due to the nature of some of these activities, may include the collection of "Personally Identifiable Information". Additionally, by accessing the Site or using the Services, we might collect additional data as set forth below in the "Aggregate Information" paragraph.

Note: Proctorio strictly adheres to the Family Education Rights Protection Act of 1974 (FERPA). Refer to the FERPA Policy for more information.
We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you to deliver certain services, news or information related to the Services, verify your authority to use our Services, and improve the content and general administration of the Site and our Services. If you are unwilling to allow your Personally Identifiable Information to be used as described in this Section, you should use the Services.

Note: Under no circumstances will this information be disseminated to third parties for any use.

Cookies.
Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies to use the site. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Proctorio may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

Note: Cookies used on this site and by the Services cannot be used to personally identify you.

Aggregate Information.
The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Third Party Services.
Proctorio uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs, help center, and knowledge bases, and to help us understand the use of our Services. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.

Data Deletion.
Proctorio will store and maintain institutional data for up to 60 days after the termination of the contract, unless otherwise specified. Data destruction will occur in one of two ways according to the institution's preference: Proctorio will 1) destroy the data, or 2) deliver it to the institution.

Law and Harm: We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Proctorio's rights or property.

Business Transfers: In the event that Proctorio is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.

Security.
We employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, which includes encryption and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your Personally Identifiable Information. The data that you transmit as part of your use of the Services ("Storage Data") is in encrypted form and Proctorio does not have access to your Storage Data in its unencrypted form.

Note: Only authorized users, defined as "School Officials" in the Family Education Rights Protection Act of 1974 (FERPA) will have the ability to decrypt any academic records stored by Proctorio.

Proctorio conducts daily security audits including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Client institutions or their designated representatives may review security testing results or conduct their own security audit of Proctorio's data security and storage practices. Written requests for inspection and testing can be made to data@proctorio.com.

Data Breach Notification.
Proctorio maintains an information security plan to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of users and client institutions. As part of its information security plan, Proctorio will notify affected individuals and institutions of a data security breach without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 72 hours from discovery of the breach. Written notification will be sent by first-class mail to the address on record for the individual or institution.

Written notification will contain:

A brief description of what occurred with respect to the breach, including, to the extent known, the date of the breach and the date on which the breach was discovered;

A description of the types of PII that were involved in the breach;

A description of the steps the affected individual or institution should take to protect against potential harm from the breach;

A description of what Proctorio is doing to investigate and mitigate the breach and to prevent future breaches; and

Contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which will include a toll-free telephone number, an email address, website or postal address.

In the event that Proctorio determines individuals or institutions should be notified urgently of a breach because of possible imminent misuse of unsecured PII, Proctorio may, in addition to providing notice as outlined above, contact the individual or institution by telephone or other means, as appropriate.
